      ProjectDescription: >
       The project started with exploring several fascinating concepts like mechanisms, origami,
       topological insulators, form-finding, metamaterials, and topological mechanics. Following this,
       a spring ball model of plate was developed which helped in studying deformations under non-trivial strain fields.

       The project was directed towards developing design and control methodology for an adaptive bridge prototype.
       Adaptive structures are the one which undergo controlled shape changes to achieve a configuration which
       maximizes the efficiency of the structure in carrying the applied load. As a result of this improved efficiency,
       significant material and energy savings can be achieved.

      ProjectDescription: >
       This project involved using Genetic Algorithm to optimize a Fiber Reinforced Plastic based structure with more
       than 13,000 members. Genetic Algorithm belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithm inspired by the
       process of natural selection.

      ProjectDescription: >
        The acronym LEAF stands for Light weight, Energy efficient Abode for the Future.The prototype model consists 
        of an outer box, within which multiple flexible components are enclosed; this provides a large variety of 
        spaces based on user requirements. The project strives to encourage community building and aid in self-built
        modular housing. Moreover, Project Leaf offers new opportunities for economic generation in small-scale
        households. The technical objectives of the project are directed towards developing a zero-impact house, which
        encompasses minimizing the energy use and negative impact that conventional buildings have on the environment.

        Project solarise was aimed at building a Net-Positive, fully-functional, 1,800 sq-ft (G + 1) house
        designed by integrating traditional architecture with contemporary interior designs, modern lifestyle
        and futuristic amenities. Passive solar architecture is the central design tenet with the aim of reducing
        the requirement for artificial thermal and lighting control as far as possible. Integrated with the concepts
        of modularity and ideas for quick assembly, the design ensures that fully-furnished house can be built
        within 20 days. This project was presented in Solar Decathlon China (SDC), 2018 edition, held in Dezhou, China.
